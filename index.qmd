# Introduction

The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE,
emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent
individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development.
The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is.
However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in.
At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role.
At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry.
Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes.

For the purpose of creating an RSE-Master Programm we identify the RSE as a person who
creates or improves research software and/or the structures that the software interacts with
in the computational environment of a research domain.
In this spectrum we see skilled team member who may also choose to conduct own research as part of their role.
But on the other end we also see paths for an RSE to specifically focus on a technical
role as an alternative to a traditional research role
because they enjoy and wish to focus on the development of research software.

For this task, to support research with/in the creation of digital tools,
we structure this sample curriculum along three pillars:

- research skills: these are competencies that enable an RSE to effectively participate in the research domain.
- technical skills: these are competencies, that enable an RSE to create effective tools for research
- communication skills: these are skills that enable an RSE to effectively work and communicate with its peers and stakeholders across multiple domains.

The RSE curriculum is based on previous work of the deRSE community such as [@Goth2024RSE].


## What is the history of natural science and computing?

## What are science-specific RSE competencies?



## What are existing fields that can be grouped under this header?

* Chemistry
   * computational chemistry
* Physics
   * computational physics
   * computational astrophysics
* Physical chemistry
   * cheminformatics
* Biology
   * bioinformatics
   * biostatistics
   * computational biology
   * computational biomodeling
* Medicine
   * digital medicine
* Earth science
   * climate modeling
   * computational oceanography
   * geographic information system

TODO: Is there a common denominater in terms of typical 

- problems
- processes
- methods/algorithm classes?

TODO: Can we map this to "Forschungsformen" from the Wissenschaftsrat? Portray this as a single graphic or something?



## How are the sciences different from other fields in terms of RSE requirements?

## What are science-specific RSE jobs?


## What should a MNT_RSE-Curriculum should look like?

This we can import from the Curriculum Project.
