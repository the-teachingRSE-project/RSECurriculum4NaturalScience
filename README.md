# RSECurriculum4NaturalScience
Holds the paper project for the SWT Bericht on the RSE-Competency project with a focus on the MNT profile, which means RSE
applied to natural sciences. Main focus is on the competences to be taught, not the structure.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

- edit `index.qmd` following [quarto markdown rules](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
- in `my-paper.bib` add further bib records
- NOTE: if you have problems with the quarto pipeline, just add the content to index.qmd file and I will check this out

## HOW to run

- install quarto with tinytex extension
- run quarto render index.qmd --to pdf (should produce a pdf in LNI format)
- debug problems in generated index.tex file


## Content TODOs

-	What are (natural) science specific RSE jobs?
-	What are science specific RSE competencies?
-	What are existing fields (computational physics etc.) that can be grouped under this header?
-	How are the sciences different from other fields in terms of RSE requirements?
-	What should a MNT_RSE-Curriculum should look like? (This we can import from the Curriculum Project)


## Technical TODOs

- add templating for authors
- cross-linking might be impossible
